Salary Predictor AI 🚀
A complete machine learning web application that predicts an employee's salary based on their experience, job role, education, and other factors.

✨ Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data creation and model training to deployment as an interactive web application. The core of the project is an XGBoost regression model trained to predict salary values, which is then served via a Flask backend to a beautiful, responsive front-end built with HTML and Tailwind CSS.

📋 Features
Advanced ML Model: Utilizes an XGBoost model for high prediction accuracy.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Employs RandomizedSearchCV to find the optimal model configuration.

Data Visualization: Generates plots for feature importance and model performance (Actual vs. Predicted).

Interactive UI: A user-friendly web interface for making live predictions.

Python Backend: Built with the lightweight and powerful Flask web framework.

Modern Frontend: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive design.

🛠️ How to Run This Project
To get this project running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed. You will also need to install the required libraries. You can do this by running:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn joblib flask

2. File Structure
Ensure your project folder is set up correctly:

salary_predictor_app/
├── app.py                         # The Flask web server
├── salary_prediction_pipeline_enhanced.joblib  # The trained ML model
├── README.md                      # This file
│
└── templates/
    └── index.html                 # The HTML front-end

3. Generate the Model File
If you don't have the .joblib file, you must first run the model training script (salary_prediction_model_py from our conversation) to generate it.

4. Launch the Web Application
Once your files are in place, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the Flask app:

python app.py

5. View in Browser
Open your web browser and go to the following address:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

You should now see the application running!
